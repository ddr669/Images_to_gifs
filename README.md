# Images to gif
```transforma_gif.py --path path_to_files --size 2 --frame 12 --out out_file```


## cmdline_verify 
Just some functions to make the options more easy and clearly like framerate, extensions if yu wanto specificy
some extensions the scripts will read only images with that extension.
the ideia is make the things more fast, too soon is comming a GUI.
